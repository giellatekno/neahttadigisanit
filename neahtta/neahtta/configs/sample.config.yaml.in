# Some helpful aliases for paths below.
Tools:
  xfst_lookup: &LOOKUP '/usr/bin/lookup'
  opt: &OPT '/opt/smi'

# Note that YAML doesn't support concatenating strings directly, 
# so in this case I use list notation. See the examples below.
#
# To avoid repeating, feel free to set aliases for things like
# shared FST format settings (as demonstrated with `&sme_fst_options` and 
# `<<: *sme_fst_options`. This is a YAML alias pattern.

Morphology:
  # This is the default setup for sme.
  sme:
    # String.
    # When format (below) is "hfst" or "xfst", NDS uses an external program
    # to do queries against the language model files (field "file" and
    # "inverse_file"). If the format is selected as "pyhfst", this field is
    # ignored.
    tool: *LOOKUP
    # String. Absolute path to the analysis file
    file: '/opt/smi/sme/bin/analyser-dict-gt-desc.xfst'
    # String. Absolute path to the generator file
    inverse_file: [*OPT, '/sme/bin/generator-dict-gt-norm.xfst'
    # String. Either "hfst", "xfst", or "pyhfst". Using "pyhfst" requires that
    # the package is installed with the "pyhfst" extra dependency (see readme).
    # "pyhfst" uses the native python bindings to the hfst library directly,
    # to do queries against the language model files, instead of shelling out.
    # Therefore, if "pyhfst" is selected, the "tool" field is ignored. Note
    # that using "pyhfst" will use more memory, but that queries against
    # language models will be quite significantly faster. "pyhfst" cannot be
    # used on the server, for now (python bindings to libhfst aren't built for
    # targets with an old libc version, like our server...)
    format: 'hfst'
    options: &sme_fst_options
