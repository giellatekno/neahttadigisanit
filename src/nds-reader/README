# What is this?

This is a module for providing access to a dictionary API, giving users access
to lexical information without need to understand what word or wordform they
are looking at.

## Goals and TODOs

- TODO: hs.fi has problems showing the options tab, should be a good place to test

- TODO: recompile bootstrap from less with specific namespace to ensure
        that style changes only occur in webdict_options and the popup.

- TODO: test function for changing hostname of API

- TODO: Internationalization of help text to nob, sme, fin, other languages
  supported

- TODO: Alternate means of triggering lookups so that there is no necessity
  to hold Alt/Opt while clicking, for devices that do not have this.
  Potentially also, displaying the result lookup in another format for
  mobile devices (Popup banner fixed to the bottom edge?).


## Installation of plugin for a specific site

See `kursadict.plugin.html` for an example of the bare minimum. Note the code
required for the search form.

## Developing

### Developing with the core files 

You will need some tools to help develop and compile the modules here, namely
node.js and npm. Otherwise, this module uses both JavaScript, and CoffeeScript[1],
the latter of which is a fabulous (completely) JavaScript compliant abstraction
from JavaScript which makes many programming concepts more accessible. It is
kind of another language, but not really, and is very easy to switch over to
using.

    [1]: http://coffeescript.org

Coffeescript quickly compiles into JavaScript, but in addition, there are some
other handy tools available in the Node.js 'system' that are necessary for 
compiling the modules here into a minimum of files, and a variety of targets.

#### node.js and npm

Install these first, and then run

    npm install

Which will read package.json, and install the development packages to help

#### Cake

... is just a build system like Make, but for node/coffeescript
projects. It facilitates compiling and combining all the
dependencies into two files.

    cake build

Will compile for all targets.

## Twitter Bootstrap

Twitter Bootstrap is in use for CSS and JavaScript conveniences like popups,
tooltips, and form elements. There is also a little custom code to handle
dropdown buttons in forms.

If this needs to be included in a place where Bootstrap's CSS reset (and
basically its full install) would mess with local stylesheets too much, it is
necessary to use a subset of Bootstrap which is downloadable from their website.

However, note that the sample HTML file here includes the full bootstrap CSS, 
which can be disabled for testing, but also note that the JS utilities from 
Bootstrap and jQuery are compiled in to the final .js file, with one exception:
the base jQuery library is not included (yet?). These dependencies are clearly
listed in the HTML file to show how installation of the module works.

So...

If you need to make changes and require more parts of Twitter Bootstrap, 
here is the list of things that are in use here. Unfortunately Bootstrap 
provides no easy way to check off everything you need

http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html#variables

Uncheck everything, and select:

Base CSS
 * Labels and badges
 * Forms
 * Buttons
 * Icons

Components
 * Button groups and dropdowns
 * Navs, tabs, and pills
 * Navbar
 * Alerts

Miscellaneous
 * Wells
 * Close icon

JS Components
 * Tooltips
 * Popovers
 * Dropdowns

2 jQuery Plugins
 * Modals
 * Dropdowns
 * Tooltips
 * Popovers
 * Buttons
 * Typeahead

### Bookmarklet development

For Neahttadigisanit there is a bookmarklet that users may install in their
browser's bookmark bar. The bookmarklet javascript that they include in the
bookmark simply downloads a compiled javascript file that includes jquery, the
neahttadigisanit jquery plugin (henceforth plugin code), and a short
initialization file which calls the rest of the plugin and allows the user to
begin looking up files. The Cakefile thus has a build target
`build-bookmarklet`, which handles this.

One of the special bits of this is that the API hostname is not defined in the
plugin code, but defined within the bookmarklet javascript... This is to make
testing and development easier.

The code for the actual bookmarklet that downloads the file is instead stored
within neahtta.py, since compiling it is a little more of a specific process.

### Browser plugin development

Some of this material was somehow hard to find.

* Chrome: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/1.11/
* Safari: http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html

Might consider using FireBreath once the concept in Chrome is complete,
FireBreath allows for simultaneous development of a plugin in several browsers
concurrently.

### Wordpress plugin development

`cake build`, followed by `cake build-wordpress`.

#### Gotchas

* PHP: make sure there are no spaces or newlines after the `?>` in 
  any of the PHP files, or wordpress will freak out and nothing will load.
