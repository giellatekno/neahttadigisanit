# TODAY

 * TODO: new wordpress release

 * BUG: create_app called twice but only on first post request.

 * change cache settings for plugin js in nginx configs, some browsers are
   unwilling to get a new version even when it exists.

 * test remaining browser notes

 * refresh settings button in plugin

 * cakefile include build bookmark.min.js

 * other dictionaries page, listing links to other groups
 
 * autocomplete parse only once per file

 * a little advertising and such for the reader and page with content in specific languages 
   see script in misc/o

   Add text to reader page: "Here are the top websites that people are reading, did you know you can read them too?"

  For privacy concerns, only include top _domains_ not individual pages. Also,
  split these out by language pair used in the lookup. above list is just
  everything in access logs.

## post gtoahpa update notes

 * missing some fsts on gtoahpa - some-sme.fst is now built but with
   another name, need to make sure that configs get updated so that
   automatic scripts to copy fsts will copy the new version

 * split sanit_makedict into two for less ambiguity

 * had to force cache to refresh in my browser to make things look
   alright, could affect others

## post launch TODOs:

 * URLs
    yrk: vada.oahpa.no
    mrh, mrj: muter.oahpa.no
    kpv: kyv.oahpa.no

    myv, mdf: valks.oahpa.no
    olo, izh, liv, fkv: sanat.oahpa.no

 * bookmark icon for iOS

    /apple-touch-icon-57x57.png 
    /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 
    /apple-touch-icon.png 

 * svn move to apps/neahttadigisánit, apps/nds

 * certificates, nginx configs?

 * translate the mobile bookmark bubble, maybe modify/write one for
   android, where the process is a little more complex
 
 * do not analyze if miniparadigm exists, e.g., searching for munnje 
   results in mun, but we only want to see munnje.

 * vise miniparadigmene fra de statiske filene 
   - sjekk at alle pos er med

 * Link til read i selve ordbok-grensesnittet -- kor?
   -- "Vil du ha oversatt ord i en tekst?" 
   -- "Háliidatgo jorgalahttit sániid teavsttas?"
   -- "Haluatko käännöksen tekstissä esiintyvään sanaan?"

 * Tag part translation/localization: v. Ind Prs Pl3 -> definitions in all languages
   - main/gt/common/src/tag-no.regex

 * autocomplete SoMe variant

## Next:

 * code for context is in place, just need to go through list of
   contexts and dictionarywork.html to get them all
     
     context="mun"          -- v. prs. s1. - (mun) manan
     context="bivttas"      -- adj. attr.  - alit (bivttas)
     context="gápmagat"     -- num. ??     - guovttit (gápmagat)

 * Tag part translation/localization: v. Ind Prs Pl3 -> definitions in all languages
   - main/gt/common/src/tag-no.regex

 * Glossary page explaining each tag part. 

 * mobile menu language variant display

 * bookmarklet unload on additional click
   
 * word test-list - http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/dicts/checklist.html

 * detailed page needs autocomplete for form

 * dropdown events on mobile are a bit funny for the menu on the
   detailed view, and it is impossible to select a new language pair

 * use logger's own log message formatter

 -- 

 * Once all this is together, optimize memory usage, with specific
   attention to gtlab / gtoahpa, may be a better way to have multiple
   threads/greenlets/etc running while parsing trees into only one
   thread.

   Note: http://blog.pythonisito.com/2012/07/gevent-and-greenlets.html

## Would be nice

 * Easier means of keeping track of updating FST and lexicon
   dependencies from svn? or at least checking in svn if there are
   updates, not necessarily fetching them

 * advanced search form: here we get to have some nerdy linguistic fun.

## Testing notes for JS click plugin:

 * Firefox error - kapittel 4.1 - skuvla -> skuvlii - works, but there's
   not skuvla

   TODO: test

## Features to develop at some point:

 * Use something other than werkzeug's default cache, once things are
   ready for actual use.

 * Maybe should provide an individual process for each language pair?
   Should be easy to split off new processes by pair/endpoint. Note also
   werkzeug DispatcherMiddleware and PathDispatcher:
   http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/appdispatch/

 * added a copy of lookupserv.py, with some tweaks to generalize it for
   any lookup process. This will speed up lookups tons, since the
   slowest part is the process starting up. If each Morphology class had
   its own lookupserv that was automatically launched with the main
   service, things will go a lot faster. It may be there is a better way
   to do subprocesses for an application like this, but for now this
   will work. any improvements will just be drop-in replacements.
